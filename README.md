Services/Tools installed:
- **Nginx**
- **PHP 7.3** based on ppa:ondrej/php repo (https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/ubuntu/php). To add additional PHP extensions, please update https://github.com/nemke82/magento2gitpod/blob/master/.gitpod.Dockerfile#L15 block.
- **Python** (base version)
- **rsync**
- **mc** (Midnight commander)
- **MySQL** (Percona) 5.7 version (latest)
- **xDebug** (latest version). Note: Uncomment lines in https://github.com/nemke82/magento2gitpod/blob/master/.gitpod.Dockerfile#L36 if you need additional options enabled. There are neat tools where you can just import log file and watch graphically explained on the https://xdebug.org/docs/profiler address. I've tested http://sourceforge.net/projects/qcachegrindwin/ binary for Windows OS and it is working as expected.
